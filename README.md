# 13 Moon Galactic Calendar

A Node.js module that can be used to output a text description of the kin, kin affirmation, and 13-month calendar date for a specific Gregorian date into the terminal. It can also offer this as a JavaScript Object that can be used in other scripts.

The original concept for the _13 Moon Galactic Calendar_ was created by José and Lloydine Argüelles and is a modern adaptation of the Mayan Calendar. The calendar has the following features that are interesting:

* Perpetual 13-month, 28-day, 365-day calendar with one Day Out of Time on 25th July
* Calendar days are always synchronized to the same Gregorian calendar days
* 260 day Tzolkin count based on the Mayan Tzolkin, with a kin for each day
* Calender has repeating cycles in groups of 13 and 20, representing a view of time that is cyclical and fractal
* The year begins on 26th July when the star Sirius rises with the Sun
* To stay in sych with leap years, February 29th is a second Day Out of Time on the 13 Moon Calendar
** _Note: There is an open issue with leap years at the moment._

You can read more about the calendar at the [Law of Time](https://www.lawoftime.org) website. I am not affiliated with any of these entities; I was just inspired to create something I could use to copypasta the information for a certain date into my journal.

## Output Example
```
Galactic Calendar Date for Fri Apr 30 2021

Limi, Planetary Dog Moon 27
Blue Lunar Storm Year

Kin 137: Red Resonant Earth
I Channel in order to Evolve,
Inspiring Synchronicity.
I seal the Matrix of Navigation
With the Resonant tone of Attunement. 
I am guided by the power of Universal Water.
```

## Quick Instructions

Take a look at the `galactic.js` file in a text editor for usage examples. You can see the output by running `node galactic` from the project directory, after you have run `git clone` or [downloaded](https://github.com/unboundhuman/galactic-calendar/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzipped the code.

If you don't have Node.js on your system, find out how to get it at [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

## Alpha Software

I put this together over a couple of days. It could use some comments in the code, better instructions in the README, and it may have unseen bugs. But it seems to be to working pretty accurately in comparison to the results from online _13 Moon_ calendars.
