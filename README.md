# 13 Moon Galactic Calendar

A Node.js module that can be used to output a text description of the kin, kin affirmation, and 13-month calendar date for a specific Gregorian date into the terminal. It can also offer this as a JavaScript Object that can be used in other scripts.

The original concept for the _13 Moon Galactic Calendar_ was created by José and Lloydine Argüelles and is a modern adaptation of the Mayan Calendar. You can read more about it at the [Law of Time](https://www.lawoftime.org) website. I am not affiliated with any of these entities; I was just inspired to create something I could use to copypasta the date into my journal.

## Quick Instructions

Take a look at the `galactic.js` file in a text editor for usage examples. You can see the output by running `node galactic` from the project directory, after you have run `git clone` or [downloaded](https://github.com/unboundhuman/galactic-calendar/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzipped the code.

If you don't have Node.js on your system, find out how to get it at [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

## Alpha Software

I put this together over a couple of days. It could use some comments in the code, better instructions in the README, and it may have unseen bugs. But it seems to be to working pretty accurately in comparison to the results from online _13 Moon_ calendars.
